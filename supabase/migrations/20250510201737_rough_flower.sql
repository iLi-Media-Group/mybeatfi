/*
  # Sales Analytics System

  1. Creates materialized view for comprehensive sales analytics
  2. Adds refresh function and triggers
  3. Creates necessary indexes for performance

  This migration provides:
  - Monthly sales aggregation
  - Producer performance metrics
  - Revenue tracking
  - Customer analytics
