/*
  # Fix sales analytics refresh trigger permissions

  1. Changes
    - Modify refresh_sales_analytics trigger function to use SECURITY DEFINER
    - Grant necessary permissions to public role
    - Drop and recreate trigger to apply changes

  2. Security
    - Function will now execute with owner privileges
    - Public role gets minimal required permissions
*/

  FOR EACH STATEMENT
  EXECUTE FUNCTION refresh_sales_analytics();

-- Grant necessary permissions
