/*
  # Sales Analytics Materialized View

  1. Overview
    Creates a materialized view for tracking sales analytics with producer-specific metrics
    
  2. Changes
    - Drops existing view and related objects
    - Creates materialized view with monthly and producer statistics
    - Adds refresh function and triggers
    - Creates optimized indexes
    
  3. Notes
    - Uses CONCURRENTLY refresh for better performance
    - Includes unique constraints for efficient refreshing
