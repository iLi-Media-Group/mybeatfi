  # Split Admin RLS Policies into Separate Update and Delete Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Replace combined admin CRUD policy with separate update and delete policies
    - Maintain existing admin select policy
    - Keep existing insert policy for authenticated users

  2. Policy Details
    - "Admins can update": Update access for admin role
    - "Admins can delete": Delete access for admin role
    - Preserves existing "Enable read access for admins" policy
    - Maintains "Enable insert for authenticated users" policy
