  # Fix producer_id column in sales table

  1. Changes
    - Adds producer_id column to sales table if it doesn't exist
    - Creates index for better performance
    - Adds RLS policy for producers to view their own sales
    - Updates existing sales records to set producer_id based on track's producer_id
