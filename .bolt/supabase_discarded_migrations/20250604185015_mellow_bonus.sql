/*
  # Add User Playlists

  1. New Tables
    - `playlists`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to profiles)
      - `name` (text)
      - `description` (text, nullable)
      - `is_public` (boolean)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz)
    - `playlist_tracks`
      - `playlist_id` (uuid, foreign key to playlists)
      - `track_id` (uuid, foreign key to tracks)
      - `added_at` (timestamptz)
      - `position` (integer)
  
  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on both tables
    - Add policies for user access control
    - Allow public access to public playlists
