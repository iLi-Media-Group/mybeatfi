/*
  # Fix Producer ID Function

  1. Changes
     - Drops the existing function with CASCADE to handle dependencies
     - Recreates the function with proper column qualification
  
  2. Purpose
     - Ensures the producer_id is automatically set when a sale is created
     - Uses proper table aliasing to avoid ambiguity
