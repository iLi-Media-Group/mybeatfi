/*
  # Fix chat messages RLS policies

  1. Changes
    - Add new RLS policy to allow authenticated users to insert messages in their rooms
    - Modify existing policies to ensure proper access control

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on chat_messages table
    - Add policy for message insertion
    - Ensure users can only send messages to rooms they are members of
*/

ALTER TABLE chat_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies to clean up

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in their rooms" ON chat_messages;

-- Create new policies with proper checks
