/*
  # Fix producer transactions RLS and permissions

  1. Changes
    - Add SECURITY DEFINER to calculate_producer_earnings function
    - Grant EXECUTE permission on the function to authenticated users
    - Add RLS policies for producer_transactions table
    
  2. Security
    - Function will run with owner privileges
    - Authenticated users can execute the function
    - Service role can insert records
    - Producers can view their own transactions
    - Admins can view all transactions
