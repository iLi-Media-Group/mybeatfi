  # Fix Producer Revenue Calculation

  1. Ensure producer_id column exists
  This migration ensures the producer_id column exists in the sales table
  and properly updates all existing sales records with the correct producer_id
  from the associated track.

  2. Create Trigger for New Sales
  Adds a trigger to automatically set the producer_id when a new sale is created,
  ensuring that revenue calculations always work correctly.
